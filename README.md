PyBank and PyPoll challenges
PyBank is working well and produces the correct output file with results. 
PyPoll is working correctly in the terminal but the output summary file is not showing results for all three candidates, only the last candidate to appear in the data set. 
Data for this dataset was generated by edX Boot Camps LLC, and is intended for educational purposes only.
